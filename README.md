# T-Sarah-salon

**I have created the Beauty Salon website in which anyone can check the services available in the shop and see the main highlight of our shop , they can find the working hours and contact details to book the slot online. I have used HTML, CSS, AZURE STATIC WEB APP, AZURE STORAGE ACCOUNT . I hosted the webpage using STATIC WEB APP service and used the STORAGE ACCOUNT for uploading my code to azure**
